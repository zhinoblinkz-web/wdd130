<h2>Hello! My name is Olawale Soyomi and I am 	from Ogun, Nigeria.</h2>
<p>I am currently studying Web Design and Development at BYU-IDAHO, driven by a passion to learn more about technology and how it shapes the future. Outside of tech, I’m also a chef who loves cooking, and my dream is to build my own restaurant one day. When I’m not studying or experimenting with new recipes, I enjoy listening to gospel and hip-hop music and playing simulator games.</p>
<p>I'm a creative person who loves learning,building,and turning ideas into reality.</p>
